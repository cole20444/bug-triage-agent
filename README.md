5. Select your workspace
6. Click "Create App"

### 2. Configure App Permissions

1. In your app settings, go to "OAuth & Permissions" in the left sidebar
2. Under "Scopes" â†’ "Bot Token Scopes", add these permissions:

   - `im:write` - To send direct messages

### 3. Enable Socket Mode

1. Go to "Socket Mode" in the left sidebar
2. Toggle "Enable Socket Mode" to ON
3. Enter an app-level token name (e.g., `bug-triage-agent`)
4. Copy the generated token (starts with `xapp-`) - this is your `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`

### 4. Install App to Workspace

1. Go to "Install App" in the left sidebar
2. Click "Install to Workspace"
3. Authorize the app

   - `message.im` - To handle direct messages

### 6. Set Up Environment Variables

1. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:
```bash
# Bot User OAuth Token (starts with xoxb-)
SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-your-bot-token-here

# App-Level Token for Socket Mode (starts with xapp-)
SLACK_APP_TOKEN=xapp-your-app-token-here

# OpenAI API Key for LLM Analysis (optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-api-key-here

# Azure DevOps Token for repository access (optional)
AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN=your-azure-devops-token-here

# GitHub Token for repository access (optional)
GITHUB_TOKEN=your-github-token-here
```

2. Replace the placeholder values with your actual tokens:
   - `SLACK_BOT_TOKEN`: Copy from "OAuth & Permissions" â†’ "Bot User OAuth Token" (step 4)
   - `SLACK_APP_TOKEN`: Copy from "Socket Mode" â†’ "App-Level Token" (step 3)
   - `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Get from [OpenAI Platform](https://platform.openai.com/) for AI-powered analysis
   - `AZURE_DEVOPS_TOKEN`: Get from Azure DevOps for repository access
   - `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Get from GitHub for repository access

### 7. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 8. Run the Bot

```bash
python app.py
```

## Usage

### Basic Bug Reporting

1. Invite the bot to a channel: `/invite @Bug Triage Agent`
2. Mention the bot: `@Bug Triage Agent`
3. Follow the prompts to report a bug:
   - Brief summary
   - Affected pages (URLs)
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Templates/components involved (optional)

The bot will collect the information and format it into a structured bug report.

### Advanced Investigation Commands

Once you have repository configurations set up, you can use these commands:

- `investigate BUG-2025-001` - Deep dive investigation with AI-powered analysis
- `analyze changes` - Analyze recent code changes across repositories
- `config repo project_name type url [branch] [site_type] [hosting_platform]` - Configure repository
- `list repos` - Show repository configurations
- `list reports` - Show recent bug reports
- `search [term]` - Search for reports containing specific terms
